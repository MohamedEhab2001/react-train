## 🔍 Useful Fake APIs for Practice

Use these resources for testing API requests and authentication flows during your project development:

- [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) — fake REST API for testing
- [Reqres](https://reqres.in) — fake API for user authentication and CRUD
- [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com) — fake e-commerce API
- [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) — more flexible fake data API
- [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io) — create custom endpoints for practice
- [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/hub) - Every types of API

Good luck! 🚀
